# Career-Monitor
 - Developed a webpage to display career site links and unique features not available on LinkedIn/other portals.
 - Implemented CRUD operations, a GitHub-style heatmap, and a 'last visited' feature to enhance site visit tracking.

Skills: Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, React.js


#  Problem Statement
 - Job portals often have outdated listings, and the ability to track and encourage regular visits to career sites for the latest job openings is missing on LinkedIn and other portals.



# Process
 - On click on a Link will redirect to the company's pre-set career page, update the last visit timestamp, and increase the heatmap count for the current day.
 - Perform CRUD operations such as adding a new career link for a company, tracking the last visit, deleting entries, and visualizing the updated heatmap.
