# Career-Monitor

Skills: Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, React.js

 - Developed a webpage to display career site links and unique features not available on LinkedIn/other portals.
 - Implemented CRUD operations, a GitHub-style heatmap, and a 'last visited' feature to enhance site visit tracking.




#  Problem Statement
 - Job portals often have outdated listings, and the ability to track and encourage regular visits to career sites for the latest job openings is missing on LinkedIn and other portals.



# Process
 - Clicking on a link will redirect to the company's pre-set career page, update the last visit timestamp, and increase the heatmap count for the current day.
 - Perform CRUD operations including adding new career links, tracking last visits, deleting entries, and visualizing the updated heatmap.
